# Rules and Ethos

## Objective

Technology is rapidly driving a wedge between the poor and prosperous. The
Scarlett School is determined to bridge this gap to anyone who is poor and
determined to learn. The poor generally work much harder than the wealthy, so
courses are designed to be completed at the pace of the learner, not the
teacher, and the rewards are visited on those that work the hardest, not those
with the best test scores.

## Rules

- You must have an income of $50k or less per year, and less than $100k in
  assets. You must be able to prove this. Exceptions will be made on a
  case-by-case basis.

- You will, when possible and necessary, be provided with a computer. If you
  lose or break this computer, you will not be provided with another. Please
  take care of it.

- Learning must take place. If you are progressing slowly, that is not a
  problem, as long as you are progressing. Extra tutelage and help will be
  available to struggling folks. Routine progress checks will be given to
  ensure learning is still taking place.

- Job placement will be attempted for outstanding learners, but this should not
  be expected.
