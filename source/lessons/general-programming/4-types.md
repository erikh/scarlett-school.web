# General Programming Lesson 4: Types

Fundamentally, _types provide meaning to data_, but this statement isn't very clear. The concept of a "type", similar to how we classify things in the real world, means that a portion of data is meant to represent something that is classified in a certain way.

There are lots of analogues in the real world; for instance, consider a banana. A banana is a very specific thing; a type unto itself. Two bananas aren't going to necessarily look the same, but they are both bananas. It is also a fruit, it is edible, it is yellow. It contains sugar and potassium. These are all _types_ that can be associated with a banana.

In this lesson, we will learn how we can use similar relationships to data within our programs to empower them and make them easier to understand.
